- Step 2 : Open power query editor & in view tab under Data preview section, check relevant columns.

- Step 5 : Visual filters (Slicers) were added for one field named "date_of_admission".
- Step 9 : Two card visuals were added to the canvas, one representing total number of admissions & other representing the total number of hospitals.
